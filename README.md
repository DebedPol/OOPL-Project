In our final project for the Object-Oriented Programming LAB course/subject, we have developed a complete system for employee registration management, payroll, and user account information management. This project employs a one database system with multiple tables, whereby anything entered for registration shall be stored safely with easy access for performing other operations like updates and deletion. This centralizes all the information, hence assuring reliability and efficiency in handling the data, whereby it can be retrieved and used at any time needed.
It also logs in according to the user type and provides access to the differing features. The Admin user can access the employee registration and payroll modules. The accounting users can access only the payroll module, and the HR users can access only the employee registration module. New users can also create an account if they do not have the same in the system.
